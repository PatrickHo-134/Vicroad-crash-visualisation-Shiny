The dataset is extracted from the VicRoads Crashstats database, which contains a collection of 12 files.

accident details, person with injury levels or fatality, vehicle, accident event, road condition, weather
condition and accident node with longitude and latitude references of location.

# User guide
There are 2 datasets that can be loaded into the app to plot the data. The first one includes full data of 5
year period and is cumbersome for R Studio to handle. Thus, there may be fatal errors or lagging time
generated by the app when using this file. It is recommended to use the second file
“aggregated_data(2).csv” for the app running smoothly. If there are still some problems because of the
size of the dataset, then there should be further acts to continue to reduce the size of input data.
Firstly, open app in R Studio, then click on the run button to launch the application, a window will
appear as following:
