# Vicroad-crash-visualisation-Shiny
An interactive web application created by Shiny to visualise all roads crashes in Victoria, Australia.

# Data sources
The data used in this report is provided by VicRoads and can be downloaded in the following link: https://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset/crash-stats-data-extract

Metadata is described in the following link: http://data.vicroads.vic.gov.au/metadata/Crash%20Stats%20-%20Data%20Extract%20-%20Open%20Data.html

The dataset is extracted from the VicRoads Crashstats database, which contains a collection of 12 files. Each file contain more than 165,000 rows recording every figure of road traffic accidents such as accident details, person with injury levels or fatality, vehicle, accident event, road condition, weather condition and accident node with longitude and latitude references of location.

# User guide
There are 2 datasets that can be loaded into the app to plot the data. The first one includes full data of 5 year period and is cumbersome for R Studio to handle. Thus, there may be fatal errors or lagging time generated by the app when using this file. It is recommended to use the second file “aggregated_data(2).csv” for the app running smoothly. If there are still some problems because of the size of the dataset, then there should be further acts to continue to reduce the size of input data. Firstly, open app in R Studio, then click on the run button to launch the application, a window will appear as following:

In tab “Interactive Map”, there is not much data displayed at this step, so it requires user to modify the input in side bar such as date range of data, data can be categorized by severity, speed zone, fatality or none, and checkbox to cluster data. For example,

- Date range of the data can be from “2015-01-01” to “2017-12-31”
- Categorized data points by speed zone
- Data is not clustered

Then, the map will yield an output as following figures:

Move on the second page by click on tab “Custom Chart”, the default input for search bar is Melbourne. The date range can be modified by user to display data of a certain period.

If users are concerned about the traffic in their living suburb, they can remove the current region name and type in another valid name such as Monash or Frankston.
